<h2> Description </h2>
    <p>This is my favorite meal that I love to eat! If I don't make it myself, I'm usually eating it at Mr. Max restaurant in Dallas, TX.
        This dish is a savory, pank-crusted, chicken cutlet on top of a bed of white rice with Japanese curry sauce. Some people like to add pickled onions as garnish,
        or add carrots and potatoes into the curry mix. I like it either way!
